#### data load test Performance under stress

Now letâ€™s run a stress-test transactional workload on the RDS database instance. This workload will open up 200 connections to your database and each of those connections will continuously make updates to the tables. To launch the transactional workload, go back to the AWS CLI and run this command:

```

pgbench --host <your database endpoint>--username masteruser --protocol=prepared -P 30 --time=300 --client=200 --jobs=200 <your dabase name>

```
*This will start 200 concurrent client sessions that will execute the pgbench benchmark workload against the database specified by the <your database name> parameter. The benchmark will run for 300 seconds, and the results will be printed to the terminal.*

Let's revisit some of the dashboards we looked at in the earlier section.

1. Start by looking at the monitoring tab for the database. You will see some variation in the data with the load test running, for instance you should now see a large increase in the number of database connections.

2. Let's also take a look at Performance Insights and explore the various charts as our 50 user stress-test runs.

Notice that in the above example, there is a large sky blue area on the Database load graph. The sky blue area corresponds to a large number of database sessions that are waiting on the **WALWriteLock** & **DataFileRead**event.

From a performance optimization standpoint, if we can figure out how to reduce the number of sessions waiting on the **WALWriteLock** & **DataFileRead** event, our workload can run faster.
